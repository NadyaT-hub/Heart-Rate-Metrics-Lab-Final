## Question 1

Take a look at the file labeled `data/phase0.txt`. Why might we have missing values or values that state "NO DATA" in this dataset? While we are currently ignoring these values, what might be the risk of filtering these values out?

These missing values might have been caused by the measuring device malfunction. 
We need these values to be aware of the possible issues with the measuring device or the code assessing the data coming from the participant. 

Additionaly, the pattern of appearing of incorrect values - if any - may give us an important context to take a closer look at. 

## Question 2

During sleep, we expect maximum heart rate of a phase to be **lower** than the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase does sleep occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.

I think that the participant was sleeping during the Phase 0. It is clear on the visualization that the heart rate slows down gradually, as the participant falls asleep. Maximum Heart Rate during the Phase 0 is 93, the lowest out of all phases, which corroborates these observations. 

## Question 3

During exercise, we expect the maximum heart rate of a phase to be **higher** the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase(s) does exercise occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings. 

The visualization of the Phase 2 shows us the heart rate of the participant going up and eventually slowing down, natutal process during the exercise. This phase also has the highest Maximum Heart Rate of all: 117. The exercise is occurring during the Phase 2. 

## Question 4

During regular periods of awake activity, we expect the average heart rate of a phase to be relatively **lower** than the average heart rate of other phases, but we also expect standard deviation to be **higher**. In which phase do we notice this trend?

In Phase 3 we notice a trend with the Average Heart Rate being lower than in other phases = 60.95, and Standard Deviation is high as well = 11.0. Although the highest Standard Deviation is observed during the Phase 2 = 13.38, Highest Maximum Heart Rate confirms that Phase 2 was recorded during the exercise process.
